You need: 
- Unity 2019.4+
- Universal RP and Shader Graph packages installed.

For the effect to work, you need to also attach the [Impact.cs](https://github.com/ArturoNereu/BounceShader/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Impact.cs) script to the object with the renderer component and a collider component.
